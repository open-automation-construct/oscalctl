A manual process for account management functions adds the risk of a potential oversight or other error. A comprehensive account management process that includes automation helps to ensure accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and promptly addressed. Examples include, but are not limited to, using automation to disable inactive accounts after a specified time period, or to lock accounts after a specified number of unsuccessful attempts at logon.\n\nAAA Services must be configured to automatically provide account management functions, and these functions must immediately enforce the organization's current account policy. The automated mechanisms may reside within AAA Services or may be directory services providing automated account management externally. Automated mechanisms may be composed of differing technologies that when placed together contain an overall automated mechanism supporting an organization's automated account management requirements. \n\nAccount management functions include assignment of role membership; identifying account type; specifying user access authorizations (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination; and administrative alerts. The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example, using email or text messaging to automatically notifying account managers when users are terminated or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and using automated telephonic notification to report atypical system account usage.",

Determining the correct time a particular event occurred on a system is critical when conducting forensic analysis and investigating system events. Sources outside of the configured acceptable allowance (drift) may be inaccurate. Additionally, unnecessary synchronization may have an adverse impact on system performance and may indicate malicious activity. \n\nSynchronizing internal information system clocks provides uniformity of time stamps for information systems with multiple system clocks and systems connected over a network. NTP provides an efficient and scalable method for network devices to synchronize to an accurate time source. NTP may pose a security risk if a malicious user were able to falsify NTP information. To launch an attack on the NTP infrastructure, a hacker could inject time that would be accepted by NTP clients by spoofing the IP address of a valid NTP server. To mitigate this risk, the time messages must be authenticated by the client before accepting them as a time source. \n\nTwo NTP-enabled devices can communicate in either client-server mode or peer-to-peer mode (aka \"symmetric mode\"). The peering mode is configured manually on the device and indicated in the outgoing NTP packets. The fundamental difference is the synchronization behavior: an NTP server can synchronize to a peer with better stratum, whereas it will never synchronize to its client regardless of the client's stratum. From a protocol perspective, NTP clients are no different from the NTP servers. The NTP client can synchronize to multiple NTP servers, select the best server and synchronize with it, or synchronize to the averaged value returned by the servers.\n\nA hierarchical model can be used to improve scalability. With this implementation, an NTP client can also become an NTP server providing time to downstream clients at a higher stratum level and of decreasing accuracy than that of its upstream server. To increase availability, NTP peering can be used between NTP servers. In the event the device loses connectivity to its upstream NTP server, it will be able to choose time from one of its peers. \n\nThe NTP authentication model is opposite of the typical client-server authentication model. NTP authentication enables an NTP client or peer to authenticate time received from their servers and peers. It is not used to authenticate NTP clients because NTP servers do not care about the authenticity of their clients, as they never accept any time from them.",

Determining the correct time a particular event occurred on a system is critical when conducting forensic analysis and investigating system events. Sources outside of the configured acceptable allowance (drift) may be inaccurate. Additionally, unnecessary synchronization may have an adverse impact on system performance and may indicate malicious activity. \n\nSynchronizing internal information system clocks provides uniformity of time stamps for information systems with multiple system clocks and systems connected over a network. NTP provides an efficient and scalable method for network devices to synchronize to an accurate time source.\n\nUsing a loopback address as the source address offers a multitude of uses for security, access, management, and scalability of routers. It is easier to construct appropriate ingress filters for router management plane traffic destined to the network management subnet since the source addresses will be from the range used for loopback interfaces instead of a larger range of addresses used for physical interfaces. Log information recorded by authentication and syslog servers will record the router's loopback address instead of the numerous physical interface addresses. NTP messages sent to management servers should use the loopback address as the source address.",

However, organizations may choose to establish certain rules for password generation (e.g., minimum character length for long passwords) under certain circumstances and can enforce this requirement in IA-5(1)(h). Account recovery can occur, for example, in situations when a password is forgotten. Cryptographically protected passwords include salted one-way cryptographic hashes of passwords. The list of commonly used, compromised, or expected passwords includes passwords obtained from previous breach corpuses, dictionary words, and repetitive or sequential characters.

Long passwords or passphrases are preferable over shorter passwords. Enforced composition rules provide marginal security benefits while decreasing usability. However, organizations may choose to establish certain rules for password generation (e.g., minimum character length for long passwords) under certain circumstances and can enforce this requirement in IA-5(1)(h). Account recovery can occur, for example, in situations when a password is forgotten. Cryptographically protected passwords include salted one-way cryptographic hashes of passwords. The list of commonly used, compromised, or expected passwords includes passwords obtained from previous breach corpuses, dictionary words, and repetitive or sequential characters. The list includes context-specific words, such as the name of the service, username, and derivatives thereof.",

Since HTTP is a stateless protocol, this persistence allows the web application developer to provide a robust and customizable user experience.\n\nHowever, if a web application stores user authentication information within a persistent cookie or other temporary storage mechanism, this information can be stolen and used to compromise the users account.\n\nLikewise, HTML 5 provides the developer with a client storage capability where application data larger than the 4K cookie size limit can be stored on the local client.  While this can be beneficial to the developer, this is considered insecure storage and should not be used for storing sensitive session or security tokens.  A cross site scripting attack can put this data at risk.\n\nWeb applications must clear sensitive data from files and storage areas on the client when the session is terminated.",

This does not include any manual steps taken to initiate automated processes or the use of automated systems.\n\nA comprehensive application account management process that includes automation helps to ensure accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and promptly addressed. Examples include, but are not limited to, using automation to take action on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended or terminated or by disabling accounts located in non-centralized account stores such as multiple servers. This requirement applies to all account types, including individual/user, shared, group, system, guest/anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor, temporary, and service.\n\nThe application must be configured to automatically provide account management functions and these functions must immediately enforce the organization's current account policy. The automated mechanisms may reside within the application itself or may be offered by the operating system or other infrastructure providing automated account management capabilities. Automated mechanisms may be comprised of differing technologies that when placed together contain an overall automated mechanism supporting an organization's automated account management requirements.\n\nAccount management functions include: assignment of group or role membership; identifying account type; specifying user access authorizations (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination; and administrative alerts. The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using email or text messaging to automatically notify account managers when users are terminated or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and using automated telephonic notification to report atypical system account usage.",

One way to accomplish this is for the attacker to enable an account. Notification of account enabling is one method for mitigating this risk. A comprehensive account management process will ensure an audit trail which documents the enabling of application user accounts and notifies administrators and ISSOs such accounts exist. This type of process greatly reduces the risk that accounts will be surreptitiously enabled and provides logging that can be used for forensic purposes.\n\nTo address access requirements, many application developers choose to integrate their applications with enterprise-level authentication/access/auditing mechanisms that meet or exceed access control policy requirements. Such integration allows the application developer to offload those access control functions and focus on core application features and functionality.",

To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been issued certificates by DoD-approved PKIs, all DoD systems (e.g., networks, web servers, and web portals) must be properly configured to incorporate access control methods that do not rely solely on the possession of a certificate for access. Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement.\n\nAccess control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system.\n\nThis requirement is applicable to access control enforcement applications (e.g., authentication servers) and other applications that perform information and system access control functions.",

The testing must cover all aspects and components of the application architecture.  If an application consists of a web server and a database, then both components must be tested for vulnerabilities to the fullest extent possible.\n\nVulnerability assessment tests normally utilize a combination of specialized software called application vulnerability scanners as well as custom scripts and manual tests.  In some instances, multiple tools are required in order to test all aspects of application features, functions and architecture.  The vulnerability scanner is typically configured to communicate with the application through the user interface or via an applications communication port.  In addition to using automated tools, manual tests conducted from the OS console such as executing custom scripts or reviewing configuration settings for known vulnerabilities may also be included as part of the test.\n\nTesters will typically utilize application user test accounts in order to test application features and functionality such as adding content, executing queries and completing transactions. The vulnerability testing software utilizes user actions and access as well as a list of known security vulnerabilities in order to detect and identify weak security controls or misconfigurations that could potentially be manipulated by the user or create a security vulnerability.\n\nThe Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) top 10 for 2013 includes the following top issues that should be tested.

Scanning tools include a multitude of tests that fall under these categories but may refer to these tests by a different name.\n\nTesting must be conducted on a periodic basis while the application is in production and subsequent to system changes to ensure any changes made to the system do not introduce new security vulnerabilities.",

In its simplest form, a password verifier is a computational function that is capable of creating a hash of a password and determining if the value provided by the user matches the hash. \n\nA more secure version of verifying a user knowing a password is to store the result of an iterating hash function and a large random SALT value as follows:\n\nH0 = H(pwd, H(salt))\nHn = H(Hn-1,H(salt))\n\nWhere n is a cryptographically-strong random [*3] number. Hn is stored, along with the salt. When the application wishes to verify that the user knows a password, it simply repeats the process and compares Hn with the stored Hn.\n\nA SALT is essentially a fixed-length cryptographically-strong random value. \n\nAnother method used is utilizing a keyed hash message authentication code (HMAC). HMAC calculates a message authentication code via a cryptographic hash function used in conjunction with an encryption key. The key must be protected as with any private key.\n \nApplications must only store passwords that have been cryptographically protected.",

XSS can be executed via HTML, JavaScript, VBScript, ActiveX; essentially any scripting language a browser is capable of processing.\n\nXSS vulnerabilities are created when a website does not properly sanitize, escape, or encode user input. For example, \"&lt;\" is the HTML encoding for the \"<\" character. If the encoding is performed, the script code will not execute.\n\nThere are 3 parties involved in an XSS attack, the attacker, the trusted and vulnerable website, and the victim. An attacker will take advantage of a vulnerable website that does not properly validate user input by inserting malicious code into any data entry field.\n\nWhen the victim visits the trusted website and clicks on the malicious link left by the attacker, the attacker’s script is executed in the victims browser with the trust permissions assigned to the site.\n\nThere are several different types of XSS attack and the complete details regarding XSS cannot be described completely here.\n\nTo address the issue of XSS, web application developers must escape, encode or otherwise validate all user input that is processed and output by the web server. They should also use web templates or a web development framework that provides the capability to encode or otherwise validate user input.\n\nExamples of XSS vulnerabilities can be obtained from the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) website.\n  \nThe site is available by pointing your browser to https://www.owasp.org.",

An attacker, through social engineering (e.g., e-mail or chat) creates a hyperlink which executes unwanted actions on the website the victim is authenticated to and sends it to the victim. If the victim clicks on the link, the action is executed unbeknownst to the victim.\n\nA CSRF attack executes a website request on behalf of the user which can lead to a compromise of the user’s data. What is needed to be successful is for the attacker to know the URL, an authenticated application user, and trick the user into clicking the malicious link.\n\nWhile XSS is not needed for a CSRF attack to work, XSS vulnerabilities can provide the attacker with a vector to obtain information from the user that may be used in mitigating the risk.

Software applications typically follow well-defined protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between software modules or system components. \n\nStructured messages can contain raw or unstructured data interspersed with metadata or control information. If software applications use attacker-supplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages, then the attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. \n\nConsequently, the module or component that receives the tainted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly. Prescreening inputs prior to passing to interpreters prevents the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands. Input validation helps to ensure accurate and correct inputs and prevent attacks such as cross-site scripting and a variety of injection attacks.\n\nAbsence of input validation opens an application to improper manipulation of data. The lack of input validation can lead immediate access of application, denial of service, and corruption of data.\n\nInvalid input includes presence of scripting tags within text fields, query string manipulation, and invalid data types and sizes.\n\nWhen an application validates input, it will only execute provided input after it has evaluated the input, validated the input and determined the data is in an expected format, and content is not extraneous or malformed.\n\nComprehensive application security testing and code reviews are required to ensure the application is not vulnerable to input validation vulnerabilities.\n\nApplication security code reviews should be conducted during the development phase to find and address input validation errors. When code reviews are not possible, fuzz testing can be performed on the application to attempt and identify vulnerable data input fields.",

The buffer is a sequential section of memory and when the data is written outside the memory bounds, the program can crash or malicious code can be executed.\n\nSecurity safeguards employed to protect memory include, for example, data execution prevention and address space layout randomization. Data execution prevention safeguards can either be hardware-enforced or software-enforced with hardware providing the greater strength of mechanism.\n\nBuffer overflows can manifest as stack overflows, heap overflows integer overflows and format string overflows. Each type of overflow is dependent upon the underlying application language and the context in which the overflow is executed.\n\nInteger overflows can lead to infinite looping when loop index variables are compromised and cause a denial of service.  If the integer is used in data references, the data can become corrupt. Also, using the integer in memory allocation can cause buffer overflows, and a denial of service.  Integers used in access control mechanisms can potentially trigger buffer overflows, which can be used to execute arbitrary code. \n\nAlmost all known web servers, application servers, and web application environments are susceptible to buffer overflows. Proper validation of user input is required to mitigate the risk. Notably, limiting the size of the strings a user is allowed to input to a program to a predetermined, acceptable length.\n\nA code review, static code analysis or active vulnerability or fuzz testing are methods used to identify overflows within application code.",

Vendors are constantly updating and patching their products to address newly discovered security vulnerabilities. Organizations (including any contractor to the organization) are required to promptly install security-relevant software updates (e.g., patches, service packs, and hot fixes). Flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or information system error handling must also be addressed expeditiously.\n\nOrganization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software may vary based on a variety of factors including, for example, the security category of the information system or the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw).\n\nThis requirement will apply to software patch management solutions that are used to install patches across the enclave and also to applications themselves that are not part of that patch management solution. For example, many browsers today provide the capability to install their own patch software. Patch criticality, as well as system criticality will vary. Therefore, the tactical situations regarding the patch management process will also vary. This means that the time period utilized must be a configurable parameter. Time frames for application of security-relevant software updates may be dependent upon the Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) process.\n\nThe application, or the patch management solution that is configured to patch the application, must be configured to check for and install security-relevant software updates and patches at least weekly. Patches must be applied immediately or in accordance with POA&Ms, IAVMs, CTOs, DTMs or other authoritative patching guidelines or sources.",

Automated scanning tools expedite and help to standardize security testing, they can incorporate known attack methods and procedures, test for libraries and other software modules known to be vulnerable to attack and utilize a test method known as \"fuzz testing\". Fuzz testing is a testing process where the application is provided invalid, unexpected, or random data. Poorly designed and coded applications will become unstable or crash. Properly designed and coded applications will reject improper and unexpected data input from application clients and remain stable.\n\nMany vulnerability scanning tools provide automated fuzz testing capabilities for the testing of web applications. All of these tools help to identify a wide range of application vulnerabilities including, but not limited to; buffer overflows, cross-site scripting flaws, denial of service format bugs and SQL injection, all of which can lead to a successful compromise of the system or result in a denial of service.\n\nDue to changes in the production environment, it is a good practice to schedule periodic active testing of production web applications. Ideally, this will occur prior to deployment and after updates or changes to the application production environment.\n\nIt is imperative that automated scanning tools are configured properly to ensure that all of the application components that can be tested are tested. In the case of web applications, some of the application code base may be accessible on the website and could potentially be corrected by a knowledgeable system administrator. Active testing is different from code review testing in that active testing does not require access to the application source code base. A code review requires complete code base access and is normally performed by the development team.\n\nIf vulnerability testing is not conducted, there is the distinct potential that security vulnerabilities could be unknowingly introduced into the application environment.\n\nThe following website provides an overview of fuzz testing and examples:\n\nhttp://www.owasp.org/index.php/Fuzzing",

In some cases, technology may prohibit the appropriate markings on printed documents. For example, in some cases, it is not possible to mark all pages top and bottom when a user prints from a browser. If this is the case, ask the application representative if user procedures exist for manually marking printed documents. If procedures do exist, examine the procedures to verify if the users were to follow the procedures the data would be marked correctly.\n\nAsk how these procedures are distributed to the users.\n\nIf appropriate markings are not present within the application and it is technically possible to have the markings present, this is a finding.\n\nIf it is not technically feasible to meet the minimum marking requirement and no user procedures exist or if followed the procedures will result in incorrect markings, or the procedures are not readily available to users, this is a finding.\n\nIn any case of a finding, the finding details should specify which functions failed to produce the desired results.\n\nAfter completing the test, destroy all printed output using the site’s preferred method for disposal.

These tools are often incorporated into Integrated Development Environments (IDE) so code reviews can be conducted during all stages of the development life cycle. Periodically reviewing code during the development phase makes transition to a production environment easier as flaws are continually identified and addressed during the development phase rather than en masse at the end of the development effort.\n\nCode review processes and the tools used to conduct the code review analysis will vary depending upon application architecture and the development languages utilized.\n\nIn addition to automated testing, manual code reviews may also be used to validate or augment automated code review results. Larger projects will have a large code base and will require the use of automated code review tools in order to achieve complete code review coverage.\n\nA manual code review may consist of a peer review wherein other programmers on the team manually examine source code and automated code review results for known flaws that introduce security bugs into the application.\n\nAs with any testing, there is no single best approach and the tests must be tailored to the application architecture. Use of automated tools along with manual review of code and testing results is considered a best practice when conducting code reviews. This method is the most likely way to ensure the maximum number of errors are caught and addressed prior to implementing the application in a production environment.",

Implementing coding standards provides many benefits to the development process.  These benefits include code readability, coding consistency among both individual and teams of developers as well as ease of code integration.  \n\nThe following are examples of what will typically be in a coding standards document.  This list is an example of what one can expect to find in typical coding standard documents and is not a comprehensive list:\n\n- Indent style conventions\n- Naming conventions\n- Line length conventions\n- Comment conventions\n- Programming best practices\n- Programming style conventions\n\nCoding standards allow developers to quickly adapt to code which has been developed by various members of a development team.  Coding standards are useful in the code review process as well as in situations where a team member leaves and duties must then be assigned to another team member.  \n\nCode conforming to a standard format is easier to read, especially if someone other than the original developer is examining the code.  In addition, formatted code can be debugged and corrected faster than unformatted code.\n\nIntroducing coding standards can help increase the consistency, reliability, and security of the application by ensuring common programming structures and tasks are handled by similar methods, as well as, reducing the occurrence of common logic errors.",

Threat modeling is not an approach to reviewing code, but it does complement the security code review process.\n\nThreat modeling can optimize application security by identifying objectives and vulnerabilities, and then defining countermeasures to prevent, or mitigate the effects of, threats to the system.\n\nThe lack of threat modeling will potentially leave unidentified threats for attackers to utilize to gain access to the application. To execute a threat model you should do the following:\n\n- Decompose the Application. The first step in the threat modeling process is gaining an understanding of the application and how it interacts with external entities. This includes identifying application components such as web server, application server, database server and languages used by the application. It also includes identifying network connections and the means utilized to access the application.\n\n- Determine and rank threats. Use a threat categorization methodology to understand the different threat categories.\nE.g., Auditing, authentication, configuration management and data protection. The goal of the threat categorization is to help identify threats both from the attacker perspective and the defensive perspective.\n\n- Determine countermeasures and mitigation. A lack of protection against a threat might indicate a vulnerability whose risk exposure could be mitigated with the implementation of a countermeasure.\n\nCountermeasures could include using application firewalls, IDS/IPS to block or identify known attacks against the architecture and alarming on audit log events.\n\nRefer to the OWASP website for additional details on application threat modeling.\n\nhttps://www.owasp.org/index.php/Application_Threat_Modeling",
